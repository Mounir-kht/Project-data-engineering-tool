Even the large cap stock swings have been insanity.\\nI have been trying out PlutoFi to automate some of my risk mitigation practices, but they don't offer live trading for U.S. equities yet (only papertrading), so that won't work.

Last week the market was slightly rattled with the release of hotter than expected economic data. However, major indices have held their ground and continue to be range bound. This week we have the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday followed by GDP and Jobless claims on Thursday, these are thing to keep on eye on. The markets are still in good shape and continue to trade well above the 52 week lows set in late October. Besides the major indices, there continues to be sector and industry ETFs basing along with individual companies.'}\n"
